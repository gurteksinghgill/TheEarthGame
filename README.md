# The Earth Game
*An educational geographical and historical quiz game app designed for the Android operating system.*

## Description of the app

Once started, the game randomly chooses, but does not reveal, a country. Currently, the game has two modes, a one player mode and a two player mode. The player or players are succesively provided hints about the randomly chosen country and must attempt to guess it. They may make a guess, or they may pass their turn. The first player to guess correctly, wins. If no player is able to guess correctly before the hints run out, the game wins. A major goal of the game is to be educational, in an engaging manner. The hints, which are mostly of a geographical and/or historical nature, are designed to be (hopefully) very interesting, so that, as they play, the players may learn many interesting things about the many countries on our planet Earth.

## Requirements

* Android Studio
* An Android device

## Data

The country facts database was assembled manually from scratch by the authors and may be found as a string array in the file TheEarthGame/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml. It consists of 10 facts about the many countries in our world.

## Using the app / Playing the game

To use the app and play the game, one can fork the code into Android Studio and then run the app on an Android Virtual Device. Alternatively, if one has a physical Android device, simply connect it to your computer and run the app via Android Studio on your physical device to have the game installed on your physical device.

## Further Development

In it's current state, the game is functional; however, the project is still a work in progress and is actively being developed further. In the very near future, among other things, the list of possible countries will be significantly expanded, the visual interface will be further developed, and the topics for the quiz questions will be diversified. There are also some interactions with the underlying Android operating system that need to be smoothed out. Finally, we also plan to introduce a player ranking database.
